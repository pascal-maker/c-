Exactly âœ… â€” youâ€™ve got it now.

### **When working with an external URL / API**

* **Service layer**:

  * Makes the HTTP request.
  * Parses the response (e.g., JSON â†’ C# objects).
  * Applies any business rules or validations.
  * Passes the ready-made objects to the repository for storage.

* **Repository layer**:

  * Doesnâ€™t know or care about JSON or API details.
  * Only knows how to **store** and **retrieve** data from **your** database (via SQL, EF Core, ADO.NET, etc.).

---

ðŸ’¡ **Think of it like this:**

* Service = **Translator** â†’ turns API language (JSON) into your appâ€™s language (C# models).
* Repository = **Librarian** â†’ files the translated books into your own library (database).

---

So in your **CarService**:

* `ImportCarsFromApiAsync()` fetches JSON from the API, parses it into `List<Car>`, and sends it to:
* `CarRepository.ImportCarsFromApi(cars)` which **only** focuses on inserting/updating those cars in the database.

If you want, I can give you a **side-by-side table** showing:
**External API flow** vs **Internal DB flow**
so itâ€™s crystal clear when parsing belongs to the service vs repository.
Do you want me to prepare that?
