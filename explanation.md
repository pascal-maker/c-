Yes — you’ve got the right idea 

---

### **1️⃣ Interfaces & Repositories**

* **Purpose:** Define and perform **data access** only.
* **You put here:**

  * **Parsing database rows** into objects.
  * **CRUD methods** (Get, Add, Update, Delete).
  * Method signatures in **interfaces** so all repositories follow the same rules.
  * No heavy decision-making — just “get me the data” or “save this data”.

💡 Example:
`ICarRepository.GetCarById(int id)` → Just finds the car in the database and returns it.
It doesn’t check if it’s electric, because that’s business logic for the service.

---

### **2️⃣ Services**

* **Purpose:** Contain **business logic** — the rules that decide *what* to do and *when*.
* **You put here:**

  * All **calculations** (`cost = PricePerDay × duration`)
  * All **validations** (check if car exists, check if electric is available)
  * Coordinating multiple repositories (e.g., get a car, then make a reservation)
  * Making decisions based on business requirements

💡 Example:
`CarReservationService.AddReservation(...)` → Gets the car from `CarRepository`, checks requirements, calculates cost, then calls `CarReservationRepository` to save it.

---

### **Think of it like:**

* **Repository** = 📦 *Storage worker* — fetches and stores things exactly as told.
* **Service** = 🧠 *Manager* — decides what should be fetched, checks if it’s okay, and figures out prices or rules.

---

So yes —

* **Parsing, mapping, CRUD method signatures** → Interfaces & Repositories
* **All actual “thinking” and “rules”** → Services

---

If you want, I can give you a **small table** with examples of what goes in each layer for your project so you never mix them up.
Do you want me to make that?

So, rule of thumb:
Repository = Where & how the data is stored (SQL/EF Core/Files)

Service = What to do with that data before giving it to the UI (business rules, calculations)

Exactly — in a **well-structured application** like yours:

---

### **1️⃣ Service layer (`CarReservationService`)**

* **Main job:**

  * Apply **business rules** (e.g., check if a car exists, check electric requirement, calculate cost).
  * Decide **when** and **how** to call the repository methods.
* **What you put here:**

  * All **calculations** (`cost = PricePerDay × duration`)
  * All **validations** (e.g., `"Car not found"`, `"Electric required but not available"`)
  * High-level **methods** the UI or controllers will use.

💡 Think of services as **the brains** of the operation — they decide the rules before touching the database.

---

### **2️⃣ Repository layer (`CarReservationRepository`, `CarRepository`)**

* **Main job:**

  * Do **data access only** — talk directly to the database.
  * No business logic, just CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* **What you put here:**

  * SQL commands (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
  * Data mapping (convert database rows into objects)
  * File exports/imports (e.g., `ExportToCsv`)

💡 Think of repositories as **the hands** — they fetch or save whatever the service tells them, without asking “why”.

---

### **Your current setup works like this:**

1. **UI/Menu** → Calls a method in the **service** (e.g., `AddReservation`).
2. **Service**:

   * Fetches a car from the **car repository**.
   * Validates if it exists and if it meets requirements.
   * Calculates the cost.
   * Creates a reservation object.
   * Sends it to the **reservation repository**.
3. **Repository**:

   * Inserts the reservation into the database.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**

* **Calculations & business rules** → Service
* **Database logic (SQL)** → Repository

If you want, I can make you a **short visual diagram** showing how
**UI → Service → Repository → Database** works for your `AddReservation` flow.
Do you want me to make that?
